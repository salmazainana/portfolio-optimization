This directory contains examples of usage of the Xpress Python interface.
If you installed the Xpress Suite installation, please note that it does not contain the Xpress Python module.
You can install our Python module from the Python Package Index (PyPI) or from the Conda repository by running

pip install xpress

or, if you have a Conda install,

conda install -c fico-xpress xpress

Either way, please verify that the XPAUTH_PATH environment variable is set to the full path to the license file, xpauth.xpr.
If you do not have an Xpress license, the Xpress Community license is provided with the Python module and is automatically
detected by the module provided that the XPAUTH_PATH variable is not set.

If you have any question or want to file a bug report, please email support@fico.com.

Enjoy the Xpress Python interface!
