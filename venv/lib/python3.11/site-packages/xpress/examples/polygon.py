# Problem: given n, find the n-sided polygon of largest area inscribed
# in the unit circle.
#
# While it is natural to prove that all vertices of a global optimum
# reside on the unit circle, here we formulate the problem so that
# every vertex i is at distance rho[i] from the center and at angle
# theta[i]. We would certainly expect that the local optimum found has
# all rho's are equal to 1.
