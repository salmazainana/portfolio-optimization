3.	CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. 
3.1	Purpose for Disclosure. Recipient may use Confidential Information of the Discloser only for the purposes 
of exercising Recipient's rights and fulfilling Recipient's obligations under this Agreement.

does not apply to information that: (i) is already known to Recipient at the time of disclosure and was not obtained, 
directly or indirectly, from Discloser; (ii) is independently developed by Recipient without reference to or use of the 
Discloser's Confidential Information; (iii) is obtained by Recipient from another source without a breach of any 
obligation of confidentiality owed by that source to Discloser; or (iv) is or becomes part of the public domain 
through no wrongful act of Recipient or any party that obtained the information from Recipient. If Recipient is 
served with a subpoena or other legal process, court, or governmental request or order requiring disclosure, or is 
otherwise required by law or securities exchange requirement to disclose, any of Discloser's Confidential 
Information, Recipient shall, unless prohibited by law, promptly notify Discloser of that fact and cooperate fully (at 
Discloser's expense) with Discloser and its legal counsel in opposing, seeking a protective order, seeking to limit, or 
appealing the subpoena, legal process, request, order, or requirement to the extent deemed appropriate by Discloser. 
Recipient may comply with the subpoena or other legal process or requirement after complying with the foregoing 
sentence, but only to the extent necessary for compliance. A non-public disclosure made pursuant to the foregoing 
sentence will not, by itself, remove any Confidential Information from the protections of this Agreement. 
3.3	Limitations on Disclosure and Use. Recipient shall use the same degree of care, but no less than a 
reasonable degree of care, to protect against the unauthorized disclosure or use of Discloser's Confidential 
Information as it uses to protect its own confidential information of a similar type. Recipient shall disclose 
Confidential Information of Discloser only to its employees or independent contractors who have a need to know for 
the above stated purpose, and who are bound by obligations of confidentiality no less restrictive than the terms of 
this Agreement. Recipient shall not remove any confidentiality or proprietary notices from Discloser's Confidential 
Information. If Recipient provides Discloser with comments, suggestions or other input regarding Discloser's 
Confidential Information or Intellectual Property, Discloser will have an unrestricted, worldwide, royalty-free right 
to use those comments, suggestions, or other input for any purpose and in any manner, and to authorize others to do 
so. 
3.4	Injunctive Relief. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided in Section 9.4 (Resolution of 
Disputes), the parties acknowledge that the remedies at law available for the protection of Confidential Information 
or Intellectual Property may be inadequate, and, without limiting any rights available at law, each party is entitled to 
seek injunctive relief for any breach of this Agreement relating to the protection of its Confidential Information or 
Intellectual Property rights.

person not a party to this Agreement. 
9.2	U.S. Government Users. The Fair Isaac Product is "Commercial Computer Software" (as such term is 
defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101) developed exclusively at private expense. If Client is acquiring a license to the Fair 
Isaac Product as or on behalf of a government agency (other than the Department of Defense), then Client's only 
rights to use, copy and disclose the Fair Isaac Product and Documentation as specified in Federal Acquisition 
Regulation 12.212 (48 C.F.R. 12.212), and its successors, shall be as set forth in this Commercial Computer

Computer Software license Agreement. 
9.3	Governing Law. Subject to Section 9.4 (in the event Client is not a resident of the United States or a legal 
entity organized under U.S. law), this Agreement is to be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of 
the State of New York, USA, without regard to principles of conflicts of law or international law, including without 
limitation the 1980 United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, as revised, which 
the parties expressly agree does not apply to this Agreement.
9.4	Resolution of Disputes. If Client is not a resident of the United States or a legal entity organized under U.S. 
law, any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the performance, breach, 
validity, interpretation, application, or termination hereof, including without limitation any dispute concerning the 
scope of this arbitration clause (each, a "Dispute"), must be referred to and finally resolved by binding arbitration 
conducted in New York, USA, administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") in accordance with 
the then-current AAA Rules, and judgment on the arbitration award may be entered and enforced in any court 
having jurisdiction. The arbitration is to be conducted in English. The arbitrator(s) must determine the matters at 
issue in the Dispute in accordance with the governing law specified in this Agreement. 
9.5	Compliance with Laws. Client is solely responsible for compliance with all laws relating to Client's use of 
the Fair Isaac Product, including but not limited to export control laws and regulations. 
9.6	Export Controls. In addition to any applicable license restrictions contained in this Agreement, Client 
acknowledges that products, related technical data, and technical support services are subject to compliance with 
U.S. laws and regulations that restrict export and Re-export of software, technical data, and services (including 
"deemed export"), and that diversion contrary to such laws and regulations is prohibited by law. Client shall 
comply with all applicable U.S. and local export control laws and obtain proper export licenses before Re-export of 
products and/or related technical data provided under this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, Client shall 
not knowingly transfer or supply any products or services provided under this Agreement to any person, company, 
or entity prohibited by or located in countries prohibited by U.S. export law. Further information regarding US 
export laws can be found at www.bis.doc.gov. "Re-export" means an actual shipment (if on physical media such as 
CD) or other transmission (e.g., downloaded over the Internet, emailed, etc.) of products and/or technical data from 
the country of original delivery destination to another foreign country, person, or entity. If Client fails to comply 
with the terms of this section, in addition to Fair Isaac's remedies at law and in equity, Fair Isaac may suspend 
performance of its obligations under this Agreement until Client is in compliance.
9.7	Import Licenses. Client is responsible for (i) obtaining all licenses, permits, or approvals that may be 
required to import any products and/or services into the country of designated delivery, (ii) clearing any Fair Isaac 
products or services through customs promptly upon their arrival in the country of designated delivery, and (iii) 
paying any Taxes relating to the foregoing. At Fair Isaac's request Client shall provide Fair Isaac with copies of all 
relevant import and customs clearance documentation relating to products or services provided under this 
Agreement. Fair Isaac will not be required to deliver any products or provide services to locations, persons, and/or 
entities prohibited by applicable export laws and regulations. 
9.8	Corrupt Practices. Client represents that, in connection with this Agreement, neither it nor anyone acting on 
its behalf has made or agreed to make any payment, gift, or other consideration, directly or indirectly, to or for the 
benefit of anyone who is a director, officer, employee, shareholder, or agent of Client; or who is in any manner 
connected with, any government or governmental entity; or who is an officer, agent, or employee of a political party; 
or who is a candidate for political office, where the payment, gift, or other consideration would be illegal under the 
applicable laws of the United States or any other country. The foregoing is a continuing representation, and, in 
addition to any other remedies Fair Isaac has, any failure of this representation to be true at any time is grounds for 
immediate termination of this Agreement by Fair Isaac. 
9.9	Waiver of Sovereign Immunity. If Client is a sovereign state or a state agency, or otherwise capable of 
invoking a defense of sovereign immunity with regard to any dispute under this Agreement, then Client hereby 
irrevocably waives any claim to immunity with regard to any proceedings in connection with an arbitration or 
arbitral award pursuant to this Agreement, including, without limitation, immunity from service of process, 
immunity from pre-judgment or post-judgment attachment or similar remedy, immunity from the jurisdiction of any 
court, and immunity from execution of any of its property.
9.10	Non-Waiver. No delay or omission by either party in exercising any right under this Agreement will be 
construed as a waiver of that right. No waiver will be effective unless in writing and signed by the party waiving the 
right. 
9.11	Relationship of the Parties. The relationship between the parties is that of independent contractors. This 
Agreement is not to be construed as creating any partnership, joint venture, agency, or any other form of legal 
association that would impose liability upon one party for the act or failure to act of the other party. No employee of 
a party will be deemed to be an employee of the other party by virtue of this Agreement. 
9.12	Press Releases; Publicity. Fair Isaac may issue a press release stating factual information regarding the 
relationship between Fair Isaac and Client at the time this Agreement is entered into by the parties. Fair Isaac shall 
first submit the press release to Client for Client's approval. The parties may issue additional press releases from as 
mutually agreed by the parties. All press releases or other publicity sought to be issued by either or both parties 
pursuant to this section must, prior to release, be reviewed and approved by each party, which approval may not be 
unreasonably withheld or be delayed more than 5 business days. Subject to Client's prior written consent (which 
must not be unreasonably or arbitrarily withheld), Fair Isaac may include Client's name in its marketing and 
promotional materials regarding the availability of any of its products or services to other clients.
9.13	Entire Agreement; Construction; Amendment. This Agreement represents the complete agreement of the 
parties and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements, proposals, understandings, representations, 
conditions, and communications (oral or written), as well as the terms of all existing or future purchase orders and 
acknowledgments. Any other terms, conditions, supplements, modifications, or amendments to this Agreement will 
not be binding upon either party unless expressly set forth in a writing signed by authorized representatives of Client 
and Fair Isaac. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the parties have entered into a Signed License Agreement, the 
terms of the Signed License Agreement will prevail over the terms of this Agreement.
9.14	Construction; Severability. This Agreement is not to be more strongly construed against either party, 
regardless of who is more responsible for its preparation. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be 
unenforceable, unlawful, or invalid in any respect, then that provision will be deemed ineffective only to the extent 
of its illegality or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of that provision or any of the remaining provisions 
of this Agreement. If a provision is determined to be unlawful, or invalid, then that provision is to be deemed 
severable from the remaining provisions of this Agreement, and the enforceability, validity, and lawfulness of the 
remaining provisions will not be impaired.
9.15	Force Majeure. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Fair Isaac will not be deemed 
to be in default of any provision of this Agreement or be liable to Client or to any third party for any delay, error, 
failure in performance or interruption of performance due to any act of God, terrorism, war, insurrection, riot, 
boycott, strike, or other labor or civil disturbance, interruption of power service, interruption of communications 
service, problems with the Internet, epidemic, act of any other person not under the control or direction of either 
party or other similar cause. 
9.16	Headings. The article and section headings in this Agreement are for reference only, and do not form part 
of this Agreement.
9.17	Notices. Any notices required to be given in writing under this Agreement must be sent to the recipient's 
address or facsimile number provided in the Purchasing/Quotation Documentation. Notices will be deemed given on 
the date of actual delivery, whether personally, by a recognized international overnight delivery carrier, or by 
facsimile (provided that the facsimile notice is promptly confirmed in writing using another method for giving 
notice provided in this section). Either party may change its address or facsimile number for notices at any time by 
giving written notice to the other party.
